# Coding Assessment
The parsing of the json file and calculation are modularize into different folders as these 
function serves very different functions. I also want to encapsulate the calculation and parsing and it makes the code more modularized for better readibility and scaliablity. From my perspective,the user seem to be for hiring manager/HR so user do not need to know the exact calculation. By just using this code, they can just query using the driver without knowing the underlying working.
